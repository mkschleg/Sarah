# Sarah: The Non-Terminating agent

## Basic use:
    
You need to clone jelly-bean-world and dopamine into a libs folder. Then you use pipenv `pipenv install` in the root directory. Using python `3.9.10`.

Then to run a long running agent and measure the memory of jelly bean world. Use `./mem_stat.sh <steps>` where `<steps>` is the number of steps to run. If -1 is passed in the agent will run forever.
